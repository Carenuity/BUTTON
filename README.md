## Getting Started

### Step 1: Purchase Hardware
Visit [ChipGlobe Shop](https://www.chipglobe.shop/en) to purchase the required components:
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The core of the project.
- **Button Shield**: Used for detecting presence or user input.
- **S-M-A Triple Adapter**: Simplifies hardware assembly (optional).
- **0.66" OLED Display**: Displays project data and status (optional).

### Step 2: Assemble Your Hardware
1. **Unpack Components**: Ensure you have all the required parts.
2. **Connect Components**:
   - Attach the ESP32 to the S-M-A Triple Adapter.
   - Connect the Button Shield to the adapter.
   - (Optional) Connect the OLED Display for visual feedback.
3. **Power the Board**: Use a USB cable to connect the ESP32 to your computer.

### Step 3: Install Firmware
1. Open a web browser and navigate to [Carenuity Solutions](https://solutions.carenuity.com).
2. Select the **Presence Detector** solution from the list of available firmware.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to flash the firmware to your ESP32 board.
4. Once flashing is complete, the board will restart and run the installed application.
